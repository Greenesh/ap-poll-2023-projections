      <p className="overview-text">Georgia was No. 1 in the final Associated Press Top 25 college football poll, becoming the 12th back-to-back national champion in the history of the rankings after routing TCU during the CFP National Championship.
        The Bulldogs won the College Football Playoff national championship game 65-7, securing their third AP title overallâ€”their first came in 1980. Georgia also became the 14th school with at least three AP national titles.
      The last team to finish consecutive seasons at No. 1 in the AP Top 25 was Alabama in 2011 and 2012.</p>
      
      <p className="overview-text">The 2023 college football season doesn't officially start until August, but it's never too early to look ahead and project the Top 25 rankings for next year. 
      Georgia takes the top spot in the Way-Too-Early Top 25 for '23 by Warrior Sports, but coach Kirby Smart's team will be challenged by Michigan, Ohio State, USC and Alabama. Florida State is on the rise after a 10-3 record in 2022. Coach Mike Norvell's squad returns the bulk of the team for next fall, including quarterback Jordan Travis and defensive end Jared Verse.</p>

      <p className="overview-text">In addition, could Penn State topple Michigan and Ohio State in the Big Ten? Although highly unlikely, Coach James Franklin's team won 11 games this year and is loaded for a run at the College Football Playoff in '23. With explosive offenses in place, Tennessee, Oregon and Washington are teams capable of easily exceeding this early projection, and Wake Forest transfer Sam Hartman should make Notre Dame a playoff contender as well.
