      <p className="overview-text">Georgia was No. 1 in the final Associated Press Top 25 college football poll, becoming the 12th back-to-back national champion in the history of the rankings after routing TCU on Monday night.
      Georgia received all 63 first-place votes in the poll, which is presented by Regions Bank.
      The Bulldogs won the College Football Playoff national championship game 65-7 to secure their third AP title overall. Their first came in 1980. Georgia also became the 14th school with as many as three AP national titles.
      The last team to finish consecutive seasons No. 1 in the AP Top 25 was Alabama in 2011 and â€™12.</p>
      
      <p className="overview-text">The 2023 college football season doesn't officially start until August, but it's never too early to look ahead and project the Top 25 rankings for next year. 
      Georgia takes the top spot in the Way-Too-Early Top 25 for '23 by Athlon Sports, but coach Kirby Smart's team will be pushed by Michigan, Ohio State, USC and Alabama. Also, an intriguing second tier of contenders appears to be in place next season. Florida State is on the rise after a 10-3 record in '22, and coach Mike Norvell's squad returns the bulk of the team for next fall, including quarterback Jordan Travis and end Jared Verse.</p>

      <p className="overview-text">Could Penn State topple Michigan and Ohio State in the Big Ten? Coach James Franklin's team won 11 games this year and is loaded for a run at the College Football Playoff in '23. With explosive offenses in place, Tennessee, Oregon and Washington are teams capable of easily exceeding our early projection. The arrival of Wake Forest transfer Sam Hartman should make Notre Dame a playoff contender too.
